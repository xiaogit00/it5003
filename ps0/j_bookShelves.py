Input line 1: small, medium, large books
2nd line: width of a single shelf

Basically, I have an object of size 1 to 3, 
and I want to fit them into the shelves in the best way possible. 

I'll always try to fit rthe largest books first, before fitting the smaller books. 

I can imagine some algorithms to produce a lower number than others - those take into account optimal 
slotting orders. 

I think I'll want to give it a go myself first.
